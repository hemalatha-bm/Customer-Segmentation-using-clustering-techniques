**Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques**

This project applies various clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral data, helping businesses refine their marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

**üìå Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to use clustering techniques (such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN) to identify distinct customer segments in the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset. The dataset includes demographic and behavioral information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. By grouping customers into clusters, businesses can optimize marketing efforts, allocate resources efficiently, and improve customer engagement.


**üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow**

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing**
Objective: Clean and prepare the data for clustering analysis.
Handled missing values using imputation.
Encoded categorical variables such as gender into numerical format.
Scaled numerical features (e.g., annual income, spending score) to ensure fair contribution to clustering.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Objective: Gain insights into the dataset and understand feature relationships.
Visualized distributions of key features like age, income, and spending score.
Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between features, such as the positive correlation between annual income and spending score.

**3. Clustering Algorithms**
Objective: Implement clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their features.
K-Means Clustering: Grouped customers into clusters based on spending and income patterns.
Hierarchical Clustering: Built a dendrogram to explore hierarchical relationships in the data.
DBSCAN: Detected noise and formed non-linear clusters, useful for irregularly shaped data.

**4. Model Evaluation**
Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering models.
Used Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.
Assessed clustering quality using the Silhouette Score, which measures how well-separated the clusters are.

**5. Results and Insights**
Objective: Analyze and interpret the clusters for actionable business insights.
Identified key customer segments, such as high-income, high-spending customers and budget-conscious customers.
Suggested marketing strategies for each segment (e.g., targeted promotions, loyalty programs).
